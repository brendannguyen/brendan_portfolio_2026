        Hi, I’m Brendan — a developer who loves building modern, animated,
        visually rich interfaces. I enjoy blending backend efficiency with
        creative UI design, especially when it involves React, Next.js,
        Tailwind, and dynamic components like Animate‑UI.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed opacity-80 mt-4">
        I’m always exploring new ways to make interfaces feel alive, whether
        that’s through animated headers, floating navigation, or interactive
        backgrounds. This site is my playground for experimenting with ideas
        and sharing what I learn.
